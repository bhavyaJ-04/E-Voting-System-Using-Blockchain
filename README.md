🗳️ Blockchain-Based E-Voting System

📌 Overview 

Our Blockchain-Based E-Voting System ensures secure, transparent, and tamper-proof elections by leveraging multi-chain blockchain architecture. The system consists of separate blockchains for registration, login, and voting, ensuring data integrity, anonymity, and real-time verifiability of votes.

🛠️ Key Features

✅ Multi-Blockchain Architecture - Separate blockchains for registration, login, and voting
✅ Merkle Tree Hashing - Ensures integrity and traceability of user registration and votes
✅ Secure Voter Authentication - Uses Voter ID, Aadhaar ID, Password, and Passkey for verification
✅ Multi-Chaining for Voting - Each candidate has their own blockchain for vote recording
✅ Tamper-Proof Voting System - Once a vote is cast, it remains immutable and verifiable
✅ Real-Time Vote Counting - Votes are updated and counted instantly

🚀 How It Works

1️⃣ User Registration - New voters sign up and are registered on the registration blockchain
2️⃣ User Login - Voters log in with Voter ID and Passkey (validated via registration blockchain)
3️⃣ Voting Process - Users select a candidate, and their vote is securely recorded in the candidate’s blockchain
4️⃣ Result Display - Votes are counted and displayed in real-time while ensuring anonymity
